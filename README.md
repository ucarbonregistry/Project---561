_____________
SAMPANN UTPADAN INDIA LIMITED, based in Vadodara, Gujarat, operates an integrated Effluent
Treatment Plant (ETP) within its industrial premises located at Survey No. 54/B, Pratapnagar, Savli–Jarod
Road, Samlaya, Vadodara-391520, Gujarat. The (ETP) was commissioned in November 2018, it is
designed to collect, treat, and manage 10KLD effluent generated from the reclaimed rubber processing
operations, ensuring compliance with environmental regulations and supporting responsible water
reuse practices. The treated effluent is recycled and reused within the plant itself, specifically in the
rubber batch-making process. This closed-loop system not only minimises freshwater dependency but
also exemplifies the plant’s commitment to sustainable industrial water management.

The project owner holds exclusive water user rights within the project boundary and maintains
undisputed legal title over the land where the ETP is installed, as part of its own manufacturing site in
Samlaya, Vadodara. These rights enable the company to independently manage water intake, effluent
treatment, and reuse infrastructure.

Sampann Utpadan India Limited has secured all necessary statutory approvals, including those
mandated by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board under the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, along with other applicable environmental clearances required for construction and operation of the ETP.

At the initial stage, wastewater is collected in Collection Tanks (2 KL and 8 KL capacities) located at
different site points to segregate varying effluent loads. These tanks receive low to medium TDS and
COD wastewater streams, ensuring no cross-contamination with hazardous or highly toxic substances.
From here, the effluent is pumped to a Collection cum Equalization Tank via a Filter Press, which serves
to remove oil and grease. This tank also functions to homogenize fluctuations in flow rate and pollutant
load, thereby ensuring steady downstream treatment performance. An Air Diffuser is provided within
the tank to maintain suspension and prevent sludge deposition.

Primary Chemical Treatment

The equalized effluent is transferred to Lime Dosing Tanks, where lime is added to adjust the pH and
promote the precipitation of heavy metals and other impurities. These tanks are equipped with
continuous mixing arrangements to ensure uniform chemical distribution.
The pH-adjusted effluent is then pumped to a Fenton Treatment Tank, where a chemical oxidation
reaction is induced using ferrous sulphate, hydrogen peroxide, and sulphuric acid. This step breaks down
complex organic molecules into simpler and less harmful compounds, such as CO₂, water, and inorganic
salts. Proper dosing is critical and based on online/regular monitoring of COD levels.
The oxidized water moves next to the Feed Tank, which serves as a buffer and temporary holding unit
before primary settling. This tank ensures regulated flow to the next stage and accommodates minor
load fluctuations.

In the Primary Settling Tank (PST), a coagulant is dosed from the Coagulant Dosing Tank to destabilize
and aggregate colloidal particles. To enhance flocculation and separation efficiency, polyelectrolytes are
added through a Poly Dosing Tank into a Static Mixer. The resulting sludge is then settled and removed
into a Sludge Sump before being dewatered via a Filter Press. The leachate from the filter press is routed
back to the Feed Tank, ensuring no untreated liquid is released.

Secondary Biological Treatment

The clarified supernatant from PST flows by gravity into a Bioreactor/Aeration Tank. This biological unit
promotes aerobic microbial degradation of residual organic matter. Air is continuously supplied through
diffusers, maintaining dissolved oxygen (DO) levels between 2–4 mg/L. MLSS (Mixed Liquor Suspended
Solids) and MLVSS (Mixed Liquor Volatile Suspended Solids) are regularly monitored to sustain an
optimal microbial population.

After sufficient retention, the effluent flows into the Secondary Settling Tank (SST), where biomass
separation occurs. A portion of the settled sludge is recycled to the aeration tank to maintain biomass
concentration, while the rest is sent to the sludge sump for further treatment.

Tertiary Treatment and Polishing

The clear overflow from SST is collected in a Final Storage Tank, from where it is pumped to a dual-stage
filtration system consisting of Pressure Sand Filter (PSF) and Activated Carbon Filter (ACF). These filters
remove residual suspended solids, turbidity, color, and trace organics, thereby polishing the effluent for
reuse. The treated water is then conveyed for gardening purposes, supporting the site's sustainability
goals.

Conveyance System Description
The conveyance system comprises a network of corrosion-resistant RCC pipelines, MS pipelines, and
HDPE chemical dosing lines, equipped with submersible and centrifugal pumps. These facilitate the
transfer of water between tanks and units, ensuring pressurized flow where necessary, and gravitybased flow where feasible, minimizing energy use.
Parameters for Estimation of Artificial Recharge Water Quantity

The volume of treated water diverted for reuse or artificial recharge is estimated using:

 Flow meters installed at key discharge points.

 Pump run hours and discharge capacities.

 Effluent quality parameters, especially BOD, COD, TSS, pH, and oil & grease.

 The availability window of source water is recorded during peak and non-peak industrial hours
to establish recharge timelines.

Source Water Quality and Pretreatment Needs

Source effluent typically exhibits medium TDS (~500-1000 mg/L), COD (up to 1000 mg/L), and varying pH
(6–9). Pretreatment such as oil & grease removal via filter press, pH adjustment through lime dosing,
and chemical oxidation in the Fenton Tank is crucial to prepare the water for effective biological
treatment downstream.
